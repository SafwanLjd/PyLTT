# PyLTT
A FOSS CLI Alternative to The Official MyLTT App

_This Relies on The [MyLTT](https://gitlab.com/SafwanLjd/MyLTT) API Helper_

## Note
This program can stop working if the MyLTT API got a major update, right now it's compatible with [MyLTT](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ltt)'s 1.0.46 release, which is the latest at the time of writing this.

This project hasn't been updated since February 2022, and I there are no plans to work on it any time on the future.


## Current Limitations

* Poor support for Libya Phone

### [MyLTT]((https://gitlab.com/SafwanLjd/MyLTT)) API Helper Limitations
* No support for promotions
* No support for the "extra packages"

There is no technical reason for these limitaions, it's possible to add proper support for all of these, and I probably will, someday; in the meantime, feel free to contribute yourself, help is always appreciated :)
